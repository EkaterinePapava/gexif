    =====

WHAT IT IS
==========

gexif is a GUI application which shows the EXIF tags contained in JPG
and TIFF files.

BUILDING
========

gexif requires libexif-gtk, and thus libexif and either gtk2 or gtk3.
Building from the source tar ball usually involves the commands:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

When building from source out of git, please run "autoreconf -i" first.


NOTE TO PACKAGERS
=================

The default is to build gexif with gtk2 (minimum version of gtk2: 2.6).
The configure option --with-gtk3 allows building gexif with gtk3.
